# Debug Tool Parameter Conversion Diary

## 2025-06-11: Initial Planning and Decision

**Entry 1:**

*   **Decision:** Approved the proposal to change the parameter passing mechanism for debug tools. Parameters will move from being individual XML child elements to a single JSON object string provided as the text content of the specific debug operation tag. For instance, an operation like 'debug_launch' would have its parameters (e.g., 'program', 'mode') defined within this JSON string, which resides directly inside that operation's main tag.
*   **Rationale:** This change is aimed at significantly improving the robustness of tool calls generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are generally more proficient at generating well-formed single JSON objects compared to complex, nested XML structures, thereby reducing errors related to malformed XML, truncation, or incorrect tag usage.
*   **Scope:** This affects how parameters are defined in LLM prompts, how they are parsed in [`debugTool.ts`](src/core/tools/debugTool.ts:1), and potentially how they are validated in [`debugToolValidation.ts`](src/core/tools/debugToolValidation.ts:1). Documentation and examples will require significant updates (examples will need to be carefully presented in contexts where they don't cause system confusion, such as direct chat or specialized documentation viewers, rather than in these initial markdown planning files if they prove problematic).
*   **Documentation Created:**
    *   `.roo/overview.md`
    *   `.roo/implementation_plan.md`
*   **Next Steps:** Proceed with actual code modifications as per the implementation plan if approved. This diary will be updated as work progresses.
